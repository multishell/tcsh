Hello,

I am pleased to announce that tcsh-6.15 is now available; this version
fixes a number of bugs and adds the following enhancements:

Changes:
    * Addition of a test suite
    * More configuration moved to autoconf from static constants
    * Fixed buffer sizes removed, memory allocation redone, with unwind code
    * Use only posix signal code.
    * Implement newline-and-hold and newline-and-down-history

Bug Fixes:
    * too many to enumerate here, consult the Fixes file

Some of the changes may have broken support for older operating systems.

Tcsh is an enhanced version of the Berkeley C-shell that offers command
line editing and completion plus many other little things that preserve
the length of your fingers.

Tcsh runs on most UNIX machines, VMS_POSIX, OS/2 EMX, WIN32, Amiga...
