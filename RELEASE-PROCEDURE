HOW TO RELEASE TCSH

1)  Update version number and date in patchlevel.h
2)  Note the new version and date in Fixes
3)  Update tcsh.man to have the new version and date also
    (two separate lines, with the date in different formats)
4)  Update README to have the new version.
5)  Commit changes into CVS
6)  Tag the release with TCSHx_yy_zz where
	x  == REV
	yy == VERS
	zz == PATCHLEVEL
    from patchlevel.h (the new values you picked)
7)  Export the code using the new tag you created.  Rename
    the directory from "tcsh" to "tcsh-x.yy.zz" and create
    tcsh-x.yy.zz.tar.gz
8)  Export the previous release as well
9)  Remove files that should not be in a release:
    - Announce*
    - Copyright
    - Makefile.ADMIN
    - RELEASE-PROCEDURE (this file)
10) Generate a "diff -urN" between the two directories you
    have exported, save it in patchz.gz (z is PATCHLEVEL)
11) Make the patch and the source tarball available on ftp
12) Mail an announcement to tcsh@mx.gw.com
